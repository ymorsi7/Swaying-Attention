# Swaying-Attention
For our final project in ECE 16 (Rapid Software and Hardware Design) at UCSD, my we used some of the skills we learned throughout the quarter to create a design that we had in mind. Swaying Attention is a project that aims to tackle the problem of dozing off during online class. Students not paying attention in class was a problem when school is in person but now that most students are doing school online as a result of quarantine the problem has gotten a lot worse. Many students, including ourselves, have a hard time paying attention in online lectures and end up missing a major portion of the content. To solve this problem we created Swaying attention, a program that uses eye detection to track students dozing off and gives them a reminder to stay focused. To achieve this we used Python, OpenCV, D-lib, Arduino-C code and a Sparkfun ESP32 board. Our prototype is able to detect drowsiness and outputs a message to the student on a display as well as making noise with a buzzer to get their attention.
